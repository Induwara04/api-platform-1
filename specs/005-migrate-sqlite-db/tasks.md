# Tasks: Database Migration from BBolt to SQLite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-migrate-sqlite-db/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md
**Feature Branch**: `005-migrate-sqlite-db`

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Test tasks are included only for critical integration scenarios. Unit tests will be updated as part of implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single Go project: `gateway/gateway-controller/`
- Paths are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization, dependency management, and cleanup preparation

- [X] T001 Update go.mod to add github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 dependency in gateway/gateway-controller/go.mod
- [X] T002 [P] Create SQLite schema SQL file in gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/storage/schema.sql
- [X] T003 [P] Create test data directory structure for SQLite testing in gateway/gateway-controller/tests/testdata/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core storage abstraction that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Remove AuditLogger interface and related types from gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/storage/interface.go
- [X] T005 Create SQLiteStorage struct and constructor in gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/storage/sqlite.go
- [X] T006 Implement initSchema method with embedded SQL in gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/storage/sqlite.go
- [X] T007 Implement database connection management with WAL mode and connection pooling in gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/storage/sqlite.go

- [X] T010 Update configuration validator to remove BBolt validation and add storage type validation (sqlite/postgres/memory) in gateway/gateway-controller/pkg/config/validator.go

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Gateway Persistence with SQLite (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Replace BBolt with SQLite for persistent storage, enabling operators to manage API configurations with standard SQL tooling and ensuring zero data loss across restarts.

**Independent Test**: Create API configurations via REST API, restart gateway-controller, and verify all configurations are restored from SQLite database.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T024 [US1] Verify SQLite database file creation and schema initialization in gateway/gateway-controller/tests/integration/schema_test.go

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - API configurations persist in SQLite and survive restarts

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Simplified Testing with Memory-Only Mode (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable developers to test gateway-controller without persistent storage, allowing fast development iterations and CI/CD pipelines without file system dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Start gateway-controller with storage.type: memory, submit API configurations, verify they work during the session but are lost after restart.

- [X] T027 [US2] Update config-memory-only.yaml example to use storage.type: memory in gateway/gateway-controller/config/config-memory-only.yaml
- [X] T028 [US2] Add test for memory-only mode with configuration loss on restart in gateway/gateway-controller/tests/integration/memory_mode_test.go
- [X] T029 [US2] Verify CRUD operations work identically in both modes in gateway/gateway-controller/tests/integration/storage_parity_test.go

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - persistent and memory-only modes both functional

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Future Database Engine Flexibility (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure storage layer abstraction supports future migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL without requiring major code changes.

**Independent Test**: Review codebase to confirm all database operations go through Storage interface with no SQLite-specific code in business logic.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Cleanup (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (SQLite implementation working)
- **Documentation (Phase 7)**: Can start after User Story 1, complete before final testing
- **Testing (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories + cleanup + documentation
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all testing passing

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1 but builds on same infrastructure
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Architectural review, independent from US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**:
  - T011-T017 (CRUD methods) can run in parallel
  - T018 (LoadFromDatabase) depends on T011-T017
  - T019-T020 (main.go updates) depend on T018
  - T021-T024 (tests) can run in parallel after implementation complete

- **US2**:
  - T025-T027 (config updates) can run in parallel
  - T028-T029 (tests) depend on T025-T027

- **US3**:
  - T030-T032 (interface review) can run in parallel
  - T033-T034 (documentation) can run in parallel with T030-T032

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup)
```bash
# All can run in parallel:
Task T002: Create schema.sql
Task T003: Create test data directories
# T001 should complete first (go.mod) before running go get
```

#### Phase 2 (Foundational)
```bash
# After T004 (interface cleanup), these can run in parallel:
Task T005: Create SQLiteStorage struct
Task T009: Update config structs
Task T010: Update config validator
# Then T006-T008 depend on T005 completing
```

#### Phase 3 (User Story 1)
```bash
# All CRUD methods can be implemented in parallel:
Task T011: Implement SaveConfig

Task T013: Implement DeleteConfig
Task T014: Implement GetConfig
Task T015: Implement GetConfigByNameVersion
Task T016: Implement GetAllConfigs

# All tests can run in parallel after implementation:
Task T021: Integration tests
Task T022: Persistence test
Task T023: Concurrency test
Task T024: Schema test
```

#### Phase 6 (Cleanup)
```bash
# These can run in parallel:
Task T036: Remove audit endpoints from OpenAPI
Task T037: Remove audit handlers
Task T038: Remove BBolt from go.mod
Task T040: Update config.yaml
Task T041: Update Makefile
```

#### Phase 7 (Documentation)
```bash
# All documentation updates can run in parallel:
Task T043: Update README BBolt references
Task T044: Update Data Storage section
Task T045: Remove audit logging docs
Task T046: Update config examples
Task T047: Add troubleshooting section
Task T048: Update architecture docs
Task T049: Add inspection guide
```

## Notes

- **Total Tasks**: 70 tasks across 9 phases
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **CGO Requirement**: mattn/go-sqlite3 requires gcc at build time - ensure Docker image includes build-essential
- **Database Path**: Default `./data/gateway.db` configured via storage.sqlite.path
- **Configuration Structure**: Hierarchical YAML with storage.type (sqlite/postgres/memory) and nested database-specific settings (storage.sqlite.*, storage.postgres.*)
- **WAL Mode**: Enabled automatically via connection string parameters
- **Backward Compatibility**: NOT REQUIRED - this is a clean-slate migration
- **Data Migration**: NOT REQUIRED - operators will recreate configurations
- **Testing Philosophy**: Integration tests focus on SQLite-specific behaviors (transactions, concurrency, persistence)
