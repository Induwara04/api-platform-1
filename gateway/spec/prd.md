# API Gateway Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

The API Gateway is a production-ready, Envoy-based gateway system that provides dynamic API configuration management through a declarative YAML/JSON interface. It consists of a Go-based Gateway-Controller (xDS server) and an Envoy Router that routes traffic according to user-provided API configurations.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Zero Manual Configuration**: Users never edit Envoy configuration files directly
- **Dynamic Updates**: API configurations applied within 5 seconds without restarts
- **Zero Downtime**: In-flight requests complete gracefully during configuration changes
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple YAML/JSON API definitions with structured validation
- **Production Ready**: Structured logging, audit trails, graceful error handling

## Functional Requirements

### [FR1: Dynamic API Configuration Management](prds/api-configuration-management.md)
- Accept API configurations in YAML/JSON format
- Validate configuration syntax and structure
- Persist configurations with ACID guarantees (bbolt)
- Support composite key identity: `{name}/{version}`
- Return structured field-level validation errors

### [FR2: xDS Server Implementation](prds/xds-server.md)
- Implement Envoy xDS v3 protocol (SotW approach)
- Push configuration updates to Router within 5 seconds
- Maintain in-memory configuration maps for fast access
- Generate complete xDS snapshots on each change
- Handle Router disconnections gracefully

### [FR3: Zero-Downtime Updates](prds/zero-downtime-updates.md)
- Update Router configuration without dropping requests
- Gracefully drain in-flight connections during updates

### [FR5: Router Traffic Handling](prds/router-traffic.md)
- Route HTTP requests to backend services based on API configurations
- Match method, path, headers as defined in API config
- Return appropriate error codes for unmatched routes (404)
- Support backend service failover and retries
- Emit structured JSON access logs for all requests

### [FR6: Observability and Troubleshooting](prds/observability.md)
- Structured logging with Zap (debug, info, warn, error)
- Configurable log levels via environment variable or CLI flag
- Debug mode includes full config diffs and xDS payloads
- JSON access logs from Router with request/response details
- Audit trail for all configuration changes

### [FR7: Policy Engine Integration](prds/policy-engine.md)
- Policy-first architecture: everything beyond routing is a policy
- Support authentication policies (API Key, OAuth, JWT)
- Support authorization policies (RBAC, scope validation)
- Support rate limiting policies (basic and distributed)
- Operation-level policy application

### [FR8: Advanced Rate Limiting (Standard Tier)](prds/rate-limiting.md)
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis backend
- Support for quota management and throttling
- Spike arrest and burst protection
- Per-API, per-application, and per-user rate limits

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Accept and validate API configurations in <1 second
- Push xDS updates to Router within 5 seconds
- Handle 100+ distinct API configurations
- Support concurrent configuration operations
- Minimal memory footprint (360-720 MB per instance)

### NFR2: Reliability
- ACID-compliant configuration storage
- Graceful handling of network disruptions
- Router waits indefinitely with backoff if xDS unavailable
- No traffic served until Router connects to xDS server
- Automatic recovery from transient failures

### NFR3: Scalability
- Support 90+ gateway instances per node
- Horizontal scaling via multiple Router instances
- Redis cluster support for distributed state (Standard tier)
- Multi-environment and sub-organization support

### NFR4: Security
- Optional API Key authentication for control plane
- Validation of all user-provided configurations
- No credential exposure in logs (redact sensitive data)
- Support for mTLS between components
- Secure gateway registration in hybrid mode

### NFR5: Developer Experience
- Clear, actionable error messages with field paths
- OpenAPI specification for Gateway-Controller API
- Comprehensive documentation and quickstart guides
- Simple Docker Compose deployment for local testing
- CLI-based management tools

### NFR6: Operability
- Docker container deployment
- Make-based build system
- Configuration as code support
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Structured logs compatible with ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch

## Success Criteria

### SC-001: Deployment Speed
Users can deploy a new API configuration and have it actively routing traffic in under 10 seconds from submission.

### SC-002: Zero-Downtime Updates
Configuration updates apply to the Router without any dropped requests or connection errors for ongoing traffic in 100% of cases.

### SC-003: Routing Accuracy
The system correctly routes 100% of requests matching configured API routes to the appropriate backend services.

### SC-004: Validation Quality
Invalid API configurations are rejected with clear, actionable error messages in 100% of cases, preventing misconfiguration.

### SC-005: Scale Support
The Gateway-Controller and Router can handle at least 100 distinct API configurations without performance degradation.

### SC-006: Configuration Consistency
System maintains 100% consistency between Gateway-Controller's stored configurations and Router's active routing behavior under normal operation.

### SC-007: Observability
All HTTP requests through the Router generate structured JSON access logs with complete request/response metadata.

## Deployment Tiers

2. **Gateway Clustering**: High availability and load balancing of Gateway-Controller (future enhancement)
3. **Web UI**: Graphical interface for configuration management (separate Management Portal component)
4. **Backend Service Discovery**: Integration with service registries like Consul or Eureka
5. **Advanced Observability Stack**: Metrics, tracing infrastructure (basic logging only)
6. **TLS Certificate Management**: Automated cert provisioning (manual configuration only)
7. **GraphQL/gRPC Support**: HTTP/REST only in initial version
8. **Configuration Import/Export**: Bulk operations and migration tools
