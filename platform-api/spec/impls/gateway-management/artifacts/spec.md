# Feature Specification: Gateway Registration Service

## Overview

Gateway registration service enables platform administrators to register gateway instances within organizations, manage secure authentication tokens with rotation and revocation capabilities, and verify gateway identity.

## Clarifications

- Q: Should the system support token revocation/rotation, or is the token permanent for the gateway's lifetime? → A: System must support both token rotation (zero-downtime: generate new token while existing one works, then revoke old token after gateway reconfiguration) and immediate revocation (security breach response: revoke token immediately, gateway cannot reconnect until new token issued and configured)
- Q: How does the system handle concurrent registration requests for the same gateway name? → A: Use database unique constraint to prevent race condition. Second request fails with "name already exists" error.
- Q: How does the system handle token verification if the gateway record has been deleted? → A: Reject token verification with "gateway not found" error. Deleting gateway invalidates all its tokens immediately.
- Q: What happens when an administrator attempts to rotate a token for a gateway that doesn't exist? → A: Reject with "gateway not found" error. Operation fails immediately with clear error message.
- Q: What happens when an administrator attempts to revoke an already-revoked token? → A: Idempotent operation - succeeds with message "token already revoked" or similar. No error thrown.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Gateway Registration (Priority: P1)

A platform administrator needs to register a new gateway instance within an organization to enable API deployment and traffic routing capabilities for that organization's APIs.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability required for any gateway to participate in the platform ecosystem. Without registration, gateways cannot authenticate or receive deployment instructions. Gateways are scoped to organizations to ensure proper isolation and access control.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting organization ID, gateway name, and display name, receiving a registration token, and verifying the gateway record is persisted with correct attributes including organization association.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the platform API is running, an organization exists, and no gateway with name "prod-gateway-01" exists within that organization, **When** an administrator submits a registration request with organization ID, name "prod-gateway-01", and display name "Production Gateway 01", **Then** the system returns a unique registration token and persists the gateway record linked to the organization
2. **Given** a gateway has been successfully registered within an organization, **When** the administrator views the gateway list for that organization, **Then** the gateway appears with its name, display name, organization association, and registration timestamp
3. **Given** a registration token has been issued, **When** the gateway presents this token for verification, **Then** the system successfully validates the token and identifies both the gateway and its associated organization

---

### User Story 2 - Duplicate Gateway Prevention (Priority: P2)

A platform administrator attempts to register a gateway with a name that already exists within the same organization, and the system prevents duplicate registrations to maintain integrity. Gateway names are unique per organization, allowing different organizations to use the same gateway names.

**Why this priority**: Prevents configuration conflicts and ensures each gateway has a unique identity within its organization. Critical for operational stability but not blocking initial functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to register two gateways with the same name within the same organization and verifying the second request is rejected with a clear error message. Additionally, verify that different organizations can successfully register gateways with the same name.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a gateway with name "prod-gateway-01" is already registered within organization A, **When** an administrator attempts to register another gateway with the same name "prod-gateway-01" within organization A, **Then** the system rejects the request with an error indicating the name is already in use within that organization
2. **Given** a gateway with name "prod-gateway-01" exists in organization A, **When** an administrator registers a gateway with name "prod-gateway-02" in organization A, **Then** the registration succeeds without conflict
3. **Given** a gateway with name "prod-gateway-01" exists in organization A, **When** an administrator registers a gateway with name "prod-gateway-01" in organization B, **Then** the registration succeeds because gateway names are unique per organization

---

### User Story 3 - Token Rotation for Zero-Downtime Updates (Priority: P2)

A platform administrator needs to rotate a gateway's authentication token without causing service interruption, allowing the gateway to continue operating during the token update process.

**Why this priority**: Essential for operational security hygiene (regular token rotation) and prevents downtime during credential updates. Critical for production environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a new token for an existing gateway, verifying both old and new tokens work simultaneously, then revoking the old token and confirming only the new token works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a gateway "prod-gateway-01" is registered with an active token, **When** an administrator requests token rotation for this gateway, **Then** the system generates a new token and returns it while keeping the existing token valid
2. **Given** a gateway has both an old token and a newly rotated token active, **When** the gateway authenticates using either token, **Then** the system successfully verifies both tokens and identifies the gateway
3. **Given** a new token has been issued and configured in the gateway, **When** an administrator revokes the old token, **Then** the system invalidates the old token while keeping the new token active

---

### User Story 4 - Immediate Token Revocation for Security Response (Priority: P2)

A platform administrator detects a potential token compromise and needs to immediately revoke the token to prevent unauthorized gateway access.

**Why this priority**: Critical security capability for breach response. Must be available before production deployment to meet security requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by revoking an active gateway token, verifying the gateway cannot authenticate with the revoked token, then issuing a new token and confirming the gateway can reconnect.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a gateway "prod-gateway-01" is registered with an active token, **When** an administrator immediately revokes the token, **Then** the system invalidates the token and the gateway cannot authenticate
2. **Given** a gateway's token has been revoked, **When** the gateway attempts to connect using the revoked token, **Then** the system rejects the authentication with an error indicating the token is no longer valid
3. **Given** a gateway's token has been revoked, **When** an administrator issues a new token for the same gateway, **Then** the system generates a new token and the gateway can authenticate after reconfiguration

---

### User Story 5 - Invalid Input Handling (Priority: P3)

A platform administrator submits incomplete or invalid gateway registration data, and the system provides clear validation errors.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience and data quality, but not critical for core functionality. Can be validated through standard input validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting various invalid inputs (empty names, special characters, excessively long values) and verifying appropriate error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the platform API is running, **When** an administrator submits a registration request with an empty gateway name, **Then** the system rejects the request with a validation error indicating the name is required
2. **Given** the platform API is running, **When** an administrator submits a registration request with an empty display name, **Then** the system rejects the request with a validation error indicating the display name is required
3. **Given** the platform API is running, **When** an administrator submits a registration request with a gateway name containing special characters or spaces, **Then** the system validates according to URL-friendly naming rules (alphanumeric with hyphens only)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a gateway name contains only whitespace characters?
- Concurrent registration requests for the same gateway name within the same organization are handled by database unique constraint on (organization_id, name), with the second request failing with "name already exists" error
- What is the maximum length for gateway name and display name fields?
- Token verification for deleted gateways is rejected with "gateway not found" error. Deleting gateway invalidates all its tokens immediately.
- What happens if the token storage mechanism fails during registration?
- Token rotation for non-existent gateways is rejected with "gateway not found" error immediately
- Revoking an already-revoked token is idempotent - succeeds with message "token already revoked" without throwing error
- What happens if a gateway has multiple active tokens and the administrator attempts another rotation before revoking older tokens?
- How does the system behave when token rotation is requested but the new token generation fails?

### Key Entities

- **Gateway**: Represents a registered gateway instance within an organization. Attributes include unique identifier (UUID), organization association (foreign key to organization), name (unique identifier per organization), display name (human-readable label), and registration timestamp. Each gateway belongs to exactly one organization, and a gateway can have one or more associated tokens throughout its lifetime. Gateway names are unique within their organization but can be reused across different organizations.
- **Gateway Token**: A cryptographically secure credential associated with a specific gateway. Attributes include token identifier, creation timestamp, revocation status (active/revoked), revocation timestamp (if revoked), and the verification-ready credential (not reversible to plain text). Multiple tokens can be active for a single gateway during rotation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-002**: Registered gateways can authenticate and be verified using their issued tokens
- **SC-003**: Gateway registration records persist correctly with all required attributes including organization association

**Token Rotation:**
- **SC-004**: Both old and new tokens work simultaneously during rotation period
- **SC-005**: Administrators can successfully revoke old tokens after configuring new tokens in gateways
- **SC-006**: Zero authentication failures occur during properly executed token rotation

**Token Revocation:**
- **SC-007**: Revoked tokens are immediately rejected with 100% accuracy
- **SC-008**: Gateways can reconnect after receiving and configuring new tokens following revocation
- **SC-009**: Token revocation operations complete successfully without affecting other active tokens

**Operational Readiness:**
- **SC-010**: Administrators can audit all token lifecycle events (creation, rotation, revocation)
- **SC-011**: System correctly tracks token status (active/revoked) for security monitoring

## Assumptions

- Gateways are scoped to organizations at the database level (each gateway belongs to exactly one organization via foreign key)
- Gateway names are unique per organization, allowing different organizations to use the same gateway names
- Gateways are exposed as root API resources at `/api/v1/gateways` (not nested under organizations in the URL)
- Organization ID is provided in the request body for registration, not in the URL path
- Deleting an organization cascades to delete all its gateways and their tokens
- Gateway names follow URL-friendly conventions (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens) - assumed based on typical naming patterns for infrastructure components
- Display names can contain spaces and mixed case for human readability
- Token verification uses one-way hashing with cryptographic best practices (bcrypt, argon2, or similar strength)
- Registration tokens are sufficiently long (minimum 32 characters) to prevent brute force attacks
- Gateway configuration with tokens happens externally and is out of scope for this feature
- No automatic token expiration is required (tokens remain valid until explicitly revoked)
- A gateway can have a maximum of 2 active tokens at any time to prevent unbounded token accumulation
- Administrators are responsible for revoking old tokens after successful rotation
- Maximum field lengths: gateway name (64 characters), display name (128 characters)
- Platform administrators have appropriate permissions to register gateways and manage tokens (authorization is handled by existing platform mechanisms)
- Token rotation is an administrative operation, not automated on a schedule
- Revoked tokens cannot be restored - new tokens must be issued
