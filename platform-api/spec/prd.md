# Platform API Product Requirements

## Product Overview

Provide a unified backend for the API Platform portals, CLI, and automation tooling, exposing secure REST APIs for organization, project, and API lifecycle management.

## Functional Requirements

- [FR1: Platform Bootstrap](prds/platform-bootstrap.md) – Automatic service initialization with configuration, database schema, and HTTPS server startup.
- [FR2: Organization Management](prds/organization-management.md) – Create and retrieve organizations with unique handles and automatic default project provisioning.
- [FR3: Project Management](prds/project-management.md) – CRUD operations for organization-scoped projects with duplicate prevention and deletion constraints.
- [FR4: API Lifecycle Management](prds/api-lifecycle-management.md) – Complete API lifecycle with security, backend, rate limiting, and operation metadata persistence.
- [FR5: Gateway Management](prds/gateway-management.md) – Gateway registration with secure token management, rotation, revocation, and organization-scoped uniqueness.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Security
All endpoints must enforce HTTPS and surface actionable error payloads; credentials stay in configuration.

### NFR2: Reliability
Database schema migrations run at startup and should be idempotent; service failures must be logged with context.

### NFR3: Operability
Service should expose health checking endpoints and support containerized deployment with SQLite by default and future RDBMS adapters.
