# Platform API Product Requirements

## Product Overview

Provide a unified backend for the API Platform portals, CLI, and automation tooling, exposing secure REST APIs for tenant, project, and API lifecycle management.

## Functional Requirements

- [FR1: Platform Bootstrap](prds/platform-bootstrap.md)
- [FR2: Organization Management](prds/organization-management.md)
- [FR3: Project Workspace Management](prds/project-workspace-management.md)
- [FR4: API Lifecycle Management](prds/api-lifecycle-management.md)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Security
All endpoints must enforce HTTPS and surface actionable error payloads; credentials stay in configuration.

### NFR2: Reliability
Database schema migrations run at startup and should be idempotent; service failures must be logged with context.

### NFR3: Operability
Service should expose health checking endpoints and support containerized deployment with SQLite by default and future RDBMS adapters.
