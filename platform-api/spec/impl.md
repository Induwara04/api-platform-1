# Platform API Implementation Overview

## Summary

Bootstrap sequence lives in `cmd/main.go` and `internal/server`, layering configuration, dependency wiring, and TLS server start-up. Domain-specific services enforce validation and coordinate repository calls backed by SQLite persistence.

## Feature Implementations

- [Platform Bootstrap](impls/platform-bootstrap.md) – Server initialization, database schema setup, and HTTPS startup.
- [Organization Management](impls/organization-management.md) – Organization creation with unique handles and automatic default project provisioning.
- [Project Management](impls/project-management.md) – Project lifecycle scoped to organizations with deletion constraints and API ownership validation.
- [API Lifecycle Management](impls/api-lifecycle-management.md) – Transactional API persistence with security configs, backend services, and operations.
- [Gateway Management](impls/gateway-management/gateway-management.md) – Gateway registration with secure token generation, rotation, and organization-scoped uniqueness.

Each implementation note captures entrypoints, supporting modules, and verification tips for manual or automated checks.
