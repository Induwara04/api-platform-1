# STS Sample OAuth2 Application

Demonstrates OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with automatic token exchange and JWT display.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: STS container running, kickstart.sh executed

# Install
pnpm install

# Run
pnpm start

# Use
# Open https://localhost:3000 in browser
# Login with default credentials: user: david, password: david123
# View access token and decoded JWT claims
```

## Configuration

Loads OAuth configuration from `../registration.yaml` (generated by kickstart.sh).

## How It Works

1. Runs HTTPS server on port 3000 (uses self-signed certificates from gate-app)
2. Redirects to STS authorization endpoint
3. User authenticates with STS
4. Receives authorization code in callback
5. Exchanges code for access token
6. Displays curl command, token, and decoded JWT claims
